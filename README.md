## Why I created Yin & Yang KDE

I found myself constantly switching between themes to match my surrounding lights. I prefer a Dark theme at Night while I want good readability at Day time. I want to easily switch my whole enviroment to a dark / light theme based on a pre defined time. I wanted to provide this as open software so everyone can benefit and I hope that I inspire other talented developers to also start a open source Project and better the Linux Desktop. This is why I created Yin-Yang.
